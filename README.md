#### Reduce Training Time by taking pre-exam in local circle
According to the current system, a driver is sent to central office for participating in competency test. This causes to increase number of participants. Again, the failed participants are to take test again which leads to the loss of time of both test controller authority and participants.
So we propose to take a pre-test on local circles preferably using VR technology so that number of participants decreases and those who have lack of training does have less time and effort to spent.
  
   
     

#### Train for driving in critical situations using VR
With the current driving competency test we only evaluate the driving skills.
But we cannot evaluate some tendency/behavior of drivers like 
 - Driving at night or low light like cloudy conditions
 - Tendency of over speeding on free road
 - Tendency of over taking  

Aforementioned things largely contributes to road accidents happen everyday.
But with current infrastructure there is no way of taking such tests. And again this is not even feasible to generate such above environments.
That is where VR technology comes to the rescue. We can train and take test of drivers in VR generating such environment or situations.
